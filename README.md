## Introduction to the project
This project constitutes a vital component of our 6th-semester coursework,
presenting a dedicated movie review website.
The platform empowers users to contribute their movie reviews and explore critiques from fellow users.
Additionally, it incorporates a robust search functionality enabling users to discover movies and apply filters based on 
language, and release year. Notably, users can curate personalized watchlists and favorite lists,
enhancing their interaction with the platform. This website caters to cinephiles seeking an interactive and feature-rich environment for both reviewing and enjoying movies.
Users can also view the statistics of different movies and actors.
